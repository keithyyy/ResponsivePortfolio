# ResponsivePortfolio
Using Bootstrap CSS to create a mobile responsive portfolio

## Getting Familiar with Bootstrap

In this project, I am assigned to use the resources and capabilities of Bootstrap to build a portfolio that's responsive to certain device screens. 

From the latest available version Bootstrap, my portfolio is supposed to respond to dimensions of 992px, 768px and 400px. The goal is to used as little external CSS as possible, and have Bootstrap do most of the work.

This portfolio has 3 working pages: About, Portfolio and Contact (which are all accessible using a **Navbar**).
The 3 working pages work off of the same 'style.css' file. 
    The CSS file has only the background image, footer, font & button styles + the media queries. 

The main content of each page sits within a bootstrap 'Card' component.

The about page is written in the 'index.html' file. It contains a image floating left and two paragraphs of text that wrap the photo. 
The Portolfio page holds only images, which uses the grid layout to organize them.
The Contact page uses the form component of bootstrap, however any values entered or pressing the submit button, will not result in anything.

The navbar and footer are both sticky!
